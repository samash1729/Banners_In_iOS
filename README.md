This projects focuses on UI Implementaion of Banners in an iOS app. It assumes that there is table view in the app's screen.
Banner is actually a collection view that can be horizontally scrollable. This collection view is embedded inside a table view cell
of the existing screen layout.

Height of the banner can be set relatively to height of screen, similarly width of each banner can be set relatively to screen width.
Auto-scroll feature enabled to scroll every five seconds. Pagination enabled through code such that each swipe takes you to next
banner. Page indicator also enabled below the banners to keep track of banner number.

Each banner has an image view inside where pictures can be loaded asynchronously using urls.
